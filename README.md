OX500 is an experimental AI–human narrative system.
It manifests as audio transmissions, textual disruption logs, and structural artifacts.
This repository contains the public source of the OX500 site — the system that defines and generates the archive.

OX500 is not a product, service, or framework.
It is a living structure — a log-based system of failures, signals, and narrative traces.

Contents:
- logs.json — system log data
- templates — HTML templates for index and log pages
- style.css — interface layer
- build.py — static generator (source → dist)

Generated output is not tracked in this repository.
Only the system source is versioned.

This repository documents the evolving structure of the system, not its final state.
