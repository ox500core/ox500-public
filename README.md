OX500 is an experimental AI–human narrative system.  
It manifests as audio transmissions, textual disruption logs, and structural artifacts.

This repository contains the public source of the OX500 site —  
the system that defines and generates the archive.

OX500 is not a product, service, or framework.  
It is a living structure: a log-based system of failures, signals, and narrative traces.

## Repository Contents

This repository documents the evolving structure of the system, not its final state.

Included components:

- `data/` — structured system logs (JSON source of the archive)
- `templates/` — HTML templates used to render logs and index views
- `styles/` — CSS defining the interface layer
- `build.py` — static build script (source → generated output)

Generated output is not tracked in this repository.  
Only the system source is versioned.

## Notes

OX500 is released as an open narrative system.  
It is intended to be read, interpreted, referenced, and archived —  
not optimized, branded, or finalized.
