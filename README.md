OX500 is an experimental AI–human narrative system.
It manifests as audio transmissions, textual disruption logs, and structural artifacts.

This repository contains the public source of the OX500 site —
the system that defines and generates the archive.

OX500 is not a product, service, or framework.
It is a living structure — a log-based system of failures, signals, and narrative traces.
